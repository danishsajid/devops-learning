#  DevOps Learning Journey

##  About This Repository
This repository documents my 90-day journey to become a DevOps engineer, focusing on automation, cloud deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, and more.

---

##  Goals

- Master Git and version control
- Learn Linux fundamentals and Bash scripting
- Automate tasks using Python
- Understand Docker and build containerized applications
- Learn Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling
- Create CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Deploy applications to cloud platforms (AWS, EC2)
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- Set up system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Build centralized logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

---

##  Progress

### [x] Day 1 – Git Setup & First Repository
- Set up GitHub and SSH
- Created and cloned first DevOps repo
- Added initial `README.md`

---

### [x] Day 2 – First Commits & Bash Scripting
- Wrote and pushed first two scripts: `system-info.sh` and `disk-usage.sh`
- Practiced `git add`, `commit`, `push`

---

### [x] Day 3 – Git Branching
- Learned:
  - `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`
  - `push origin <branch>`
  - `cherry-pick` to apply specific commits
- Created `network-info.sh` in a separate branch and merged it into main

---

### [x] Day 4 – Bash Scripting & CLI Practice
- Brushed up on Linux CLI basics (`ls`, `cd`, `vim`, `chmod`, etc.)
- Wrote two scripts:
  - `user-info.sh`: Prints user info using env variables like `$USER`, `$HOME`, `$SHELL`
  - `check-directory.sh`: Accepts a directory path and shows number of files, subdirs, total size, and top 5 largest files
- Learned to:
  - Use `if` conditionals, argument handling (`$1`, `${1:-}`), and default values
  - Add professional script headers with metadata

---

###  Coming Soon
- [ ] Day 5 – Git History, Revert, Reset, and .gitignore
- [ ] Day 6 – Git diff, selective staging, and master script
- [ ] Day 7 – Automating scripts with cron and setting up log rotation
